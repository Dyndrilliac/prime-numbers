This application generates the first 'n' prime numbers and displays them to the user. The method used to test 
for primality is fairly efficient but will naturally pale in comparison to industry standard libraries optimized 
for this task. This is merely proof of concept code. It will also approximate the amount of time in seconds that 
it took to generate the list.
